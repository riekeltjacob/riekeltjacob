## About Me 🚀

I'm Riekelt Jacob, a passionate programmer and a hands-on vehicle enthusiast. When I'm not writing code, you'll often find me under the hood, fine-tuning and tweaking vehicles to perfection. 

I thrive on challenges and love to explore the intersection of technology and mechanics, constantly seeking new ways to merge my two passions.

## What I'm Up To 🌱

Currently, I'm on a thrilling journey, diving deep into Symfony, harnessing its power to create robust web applications. Each line of code I write is a step towards mastering this incredible framework.

## Let's Collaborate 🤝

I'm always excited about collaborating on exciting projects, whether it's coding, vehicle customization, or anything that ignites curiosity. If you have a cool idea or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's build something awesome together!
